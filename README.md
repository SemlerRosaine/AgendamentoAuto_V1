# AgendamentoAuto_V1

The software AgendarAuto V1 was developed to manage the agenda of a car workshop, to facilitate the registration, control, editing, and exclusion of professionals, 
customers, cars, as well as manage the agenda with daily reporting. We used the Java language, the Hibernate framework, and the Java Swing package.
